Assumptions/Design choices: 
- arrays are sorted into acending order
- each element can only be used in one pair
- return given as an int type
- lists only contain integers 
- becuase the array is in accending order a left and right pointer method can be used this
  makes the function more efficient than comparing each element to every other element
